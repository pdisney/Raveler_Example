README

This application is a graphical representation of a users Raveler projects.  From this view a user can see all projects that are in there portfolio, they can filter projects, and be taken to a projects details page.  All actions in the application are performed via click and right-click (context menu) actions.  Not implemented are the add/remove project functionality and one could imagine that all aspects of a project could be incorporated into this type of graph.  

No server side code was used when creating this sample application, it is driven entirely off the api presented in the job listing.  

Please run using safari or firefox as the javascript graphing library used is not always compatible with IE.  Open index.html under the main Example folder and the application should open.
